# Transportation Management System API

Welcome to the Transportation Management System API! This API facilitates the management of transportation services through three main systems:

1. Manager System
2. Bus Stop System
3. Online User System

## Manager System

The Manager System allows for the creation of new managers and provides access to reports regarding the system's performance and profit.

### Endpoints:

## Bus Stop System

The Bus Stop System manages each individual bus stop, providing access to create buses, journeys, and ticketing services.

### Endpoints:

- `/busstop/create/journey`: Create a journey from one bus stop to another.
- `/busstop/ticketing/cut`: Cut tickets for passengers at a specific bus stop.

## Online User System

The Online User System caters to users who wish to book tickets and obtain information about available journeys between bus stops.

### Endpoints:

- `/user/book/ticket`: Book a ticket for a specific journey.
- `/user/journey/info`: Get information about available journeys between bus stops.

## Authentication

Authentication is required for accessing certain endpoints. Each system has its own authentication mechanism to ensure secure access.
